We need to calculate the processing and storage capacity necessary for each of the 4 plants and storages to be able to process and store at the "optimal" rate we've calculated.  Note that this is for the period where we have the non-optimal 136k FCOJ futures coming in, we're selling them all, and then also manufacturing FCOJ and reconstituting it into ROJ.

In the future optimal years, the capacities will be adjusted (processing will go down), as the optimal number of FCOJ and ROJ will all come from futures.
