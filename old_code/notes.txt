Updating pipeline:

- Rerun John's VBA to retrieve all sales data
    = demand_pipeline/VBA_sales_parse

- Update demand beliefs
    = demand_pipeline/demand_fit_plot.R

- Look at fitted demand curves for sanity check
    = demand_pipeline/sales_and_fits_plots/*.png

- Create demand look-up table
    = demand_pipeline/create_demand_table.R

- Update spot purchase beliefs
    = grove_beliefs/update_beliefs.py

- Recalculate optimal prices for ORA, POJ, ROJ
    = demand_pipeline/find_optimal_prices_ORA_POJ_ROJ.R
    = ROJ is because we use all FCOJ 136k constrained

- Recalculate optimal prices for FCOJ
    = demand_pipeline/find_optimal_prices_ROJ_FCOJ.R
    = this informs how much FCOJ futures to order

- Recalculate optimal prices for FCOJ given amount of maturing FCOJ futures is fixed at 136k
    = we only do this until the quantity becomes ~89k, at which point we start using the pricing / distribution plan given by the optimization in find_optimal_prices_ROJ_FCOJ.R
    = demand_pipeline/find_optimal_prices_FCOJ_fixed.R

- Recalculate capacity for optimal price's demands and other stuff
    = probably won't need to change, just a sanity check
    = demand_pipeline/calculate_decisions.R
