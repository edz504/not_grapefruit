We need to calculate the total amount of transportation costs incurred from moving FCOJ futures from FLA to each of the four storage systems, based on the total demand for the regions corresponding to each storage.

The transportation cost is $0.22 / ton-mile.  The R script shows that the cost is roughly $927,000 per week, or just under $45 million each year, which seems very manageable.  The purchase cost for the 2016 futures that matured in 2015 is already $305m, and the projected revenue is $515m.

We also calculate the storage to market transportation costs with these quantities, as a sanity check that we won't lose money there. (Costs were $276m last year in poorly set-up MomPop storage network).
