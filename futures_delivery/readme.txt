We need to calculate the total amount of transportation costs incurred from moving FCOJ futures from FLA to each of the four storage systems, based on the total demand for the regions corresponding to each storage.

The transportation cost is $0.22 / ton-mile.  The R script shows that the cost is roughly $927,000 per week, or just under $45 million each year, which seems very manageable.  The purchase cost for the 2016 futures that matured in 2015 is already $305m, and the projected revenue is $515m.  With storage to market costs of around $178m, we will be losing roughly $15m at best.  Starting in the next few years, when our matured futures become cheaper, we will start to make money, with our cheapest $0.92 option giving us $43m per year (...which seems like nothing).
