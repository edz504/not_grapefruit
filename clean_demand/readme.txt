get_clean_demand.py uses the Practice 1 and Practice 2 notebooks to create the ora_demand.csv, poj_demand.csv, ... files.  Beginning months were projected to month-scale (e.g. if ROJ only had sales in the last week of month 1, we multiplied the monthly sales by 4), but if any of the weeks were censored, we just zeroed out the demand.

Disregard the other files, as they are deprecated code.
